## Summary

Logged-in users can securely add a new service through the Add Services page. This page is protected by a private route and allows the user to enter service information such as title, image, company, and price. Once submitted, 
the data is sent to the backend and stored in MongoDB with the user's email and the current date. A success message is shown, and the new service becomes visible under All Services and My Services pages. 
All API routes are protected using JWT authentication, ensuring only authorized users can add services.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
